FFShare pipes videos and images through ffmpeg before you share them.

Doing so reduces the file size and also has the added benefit of stripping all metadata that may be attached to your images and videos.

To do this this just share your videos or images and choose <i>FFShare</i>. The app will open showing the compression progress and when its done a new share dialog will reappear with the new compressed video or image.
